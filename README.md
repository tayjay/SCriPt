# SCriPt
A SCP:SL plugin that provides a Lua -> EXILED programming bridge.

With this plugin you can write your own scripts that can do anything from automatically apply changes to the round on start, to creating custom gamemodes, to automating tasks on your server's operating system if you need to do so.

This plugin hooks into the EXILED Event system, allowing you to run code at any point in the game lifecycle, the same as any other plugin.

## Docs
Please check the [Docs](https://tayjay.github.io/SCriPt/LabAPI) for everything you need to know about writing Scripts for this plugin. Please give at least the first page a read before you run the plugin for the first time.

## Releases
