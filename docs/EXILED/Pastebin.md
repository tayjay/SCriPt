### Setup
Scripts can be shared and loaded from pastebin. This is a feature that is not enabled by default.
Change the following configs to allow pastebin scripts to be downloaded:
- The config option "allow_pastebin" must be manually set to true.
- System access and sandboxing levels must be at or below default options. Limited | SoftSandbox respectively.

### Getting Scripts
Once those are setup, scripts can be downloaded from pastebin using the following process:

1. Create a new file in your `Scripts` directory, name the file with the pastebin ID and the extension `.pastebin`.
2. You should now have a file named something like `KUJHSZM2.pastebin`. This is the pastebin ID of the `SkeletonCommand` script https://pastebin.com/KUJHSZM2.
3. Start the server, check that there are no errors in the console.
4. A new file will be created named with the Pastebin Id and the extension `.lua`. This file will contain the script from pastebin.

### Scripts can be edited

This script file will not be redownloaded automatically. You are free to make any changes you'd like to the script. If you want to redownload the script, you will need to delete the `.lua` file and restart the server.

### Renaming Scripts

If you want to rename the file to more easily identify it, you'll first want to delete the `.pastebin` file so it does not attempt to redownload.

You should always read the script before downloading it to ensure it is safe. You can see it at https://pastebin.com/PASTEBIN_ID_HERE

### Script Safety
Please note scripts from the internet can be **dangerous**. Make sure you trust the source before downloading any scripts.

By downloading the script locally it will reduce the chances of you being impacted if someone were to change the script on pastebin after you have checked that it is safe.
