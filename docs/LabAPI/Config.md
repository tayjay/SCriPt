## FullAccess
**This is a dangerous setting and should only be changed if you know you want it enabled.**

If True, this gives Lua scripts full access to your system. The Lua OS and other privledged libraries will be loaded. If you want to have full control over your server from in-game its good, but is not recommended for most users.


- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`
